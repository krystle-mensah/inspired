# Music blog website with custom PHP admin system

## Description

This is a php blog system using procedural style php. This project was inspired by a blog system I created doing a course on php on udemy, which I highly recommend. Here's a link to this course on Udemy:
(https://www.udemy.com/course/php-for-complete-beginners-includes-msql-object-oriented/)

## Why this project can be very Useful for You?

If you are a beginner in web development or have a interest in PHP and want to learn how to build a website from scatch with a content management system, then your in the right place. I do advise though to complete the udemy course first and use this project as a guide to help you to complete it.
